# Data Model

## Overview
This document defines the data model for Wheeler, an advanced options trading portfolio system specializing in the "wheel strategy" and Treasury collateral management. The model consists of five main entities with defined relationships and attributes, implemented in SQLite with proper indexing and constraints for modern web application patterns.

## Entities

### Symbols

**Primary Key:** symbol (TEXT)

**Attributes:**
- symbol (TEXT) - Unique stock ticker identifier (e.g., "AAPL", "MSFT")
- price (REAL) - Current stock price (default: 0.0)
- dividend (REAL) - Current dividend yield (default: 0.0)
- ex_dividend_date (DATE) - Last ex-dividend date
- pe_ratio (REAL) - Price-to-earnings ratio
- created_at (DATETIME) - Record creation timestamp (default: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
- updated_at (DATETIME) - Record update timestamp (default: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

### Long Positions

**Primary Key:** id (INTEGER AUTOINCREMENT)
**Unique Constraint:** (symbol, opened, shares, buy_price) - Prevents duplicate entries

**Attributes:**
- id (INTEGER) - Auto-incrementing primary key for web-friendly operations
- symbol (TEXT) - Foreign key to symbols table

- Unique constraint on (symbol, opened, shares, buy_price)

### Options
Represents options positions (cash-secured puts and covered calls) central to wheel strategy trading.

**Primary Key:** id (INTEGER AUTOINCREMENT)
**Unique Constraint:** (symbol, type, opened, strike, expiration, premium, contracts) - Prevents duplicate entries

**Attributes:**
- id (INTEGER) - Auto-incrementing primary key for web-friendly operations

### Primary Key Strategy

Wheeler uses a hybrid primary key approach optimized for modern web applications:

**Transactional Tables (Auto-increment IDs):**
- options.id, long_positions.id, dividends.id, transactions.id
- Web-friendly integer IDs for easy HTTP CRUD operations
- Unique constraints on business keys prevent duplicate records

**Reference Tables (Natural Keys):**
- symbols.symbol (stock ticker), treasuries.cuspid (bond identifier), settings.name (configuration key)
- Business identifiers as primary keys for reference data

## Database Indexes

### Performance Optimization Indexes
- `idx_symbols_symbol` - Primary key index on symbols.symbol
- `idx_long_positions_symbol` - Foreign key index on long_positions.symbol
- `idx_long_positions_opened` - Query optimization for date ranges
- `idx_options_symbol` - Foreign key index on options.symbol
- `idx_options_expiration` - Query optimization for expiration dates
- `idx_options_type` - Query optimization for Put/Call filtering
- `idx_dividends_symbol` - Foreign key index on dividends.symbol
- `idx_dividends_received` - Query optimization for date ranges
- `idx_transactions_symbol` - Foreign key index on transactions.symbol
- `idx_transactions_date` - Query optimization for date ranges
- `idx_transactions_type` - Query optimization for transaction type filtering
- `idx_transactions_action` - Query optimization for action filtering
- `idx_treasuries_cuspid` - Primary key index on treasuries.cuspid
- `idx_treasuries_maturity` - Query optimization for maturity dates
- `idx_treasuries_purchased` - Query optimization for purchase dates
- `idx_settings_name` - Primary key index on settings.name

## Data Constraints & Business Rules

### Referential Integrity
- All symbol references in long_positions, options, dividends, and transactions must exist in symbols table
- Foreign key constraints enforced at database level

### Data Validation
- Dates must be in valid date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Numeric values must be non-negative where applicable
- Option type must be either "Put" or "Call" (CHECK constraint)
- Compound primary keys ensure unique position identification

### Business Logic Constraints
- Long positions can have null closed date (open positions)
- Options can have null exit_price (open positions)
- Treasuries can have null current_value and exit_price (held positions)
- All monetary values stored as REAL type for precision

## Schema Evolution Notes

### Timestamp Tracking
- All tables include created_at and updated_at fields for audit trail
- Timestamps automatically set to CURRENT_TIMESTAMP on record creation
- updated_at should be manually updated on record modifications

### Web Application Optimization
- Integer primary keys provide clean URLs and easy REST API operations
- Unique constraints on business keys prevent duplicate data entry
- Foreign key constraints maintain referential integrity
- Auto-increment IDs avoid compound key complexity in web forms

### Wheel Strategy Data Flow

**Option Assignment Process:**
1. Cash-secured put expires ITM → Treasury amount decreases (collateral used)
2. New long position created with assigned shares
3. Covered call sold against new stock position
4. Call assignment → Treasury amount increases (cash received)

**Treasury Collateral Management:**
- Put assignments reduce Treasury balances (cash used for stock purchase)
- Call assignments increase Treasury balances (stock sold for cash)
- Interest payments add new Treasury entries quarterly
- Treasury table independent of symbols (bonds vs. stocks)
